Undergraduate Capstone Project 

The purpose of this project is to simulate a scalable Java-based game in which teams of players could compete against each other using multirotors equipped with IR(infrared) optics and sensors. This is essentially creating a new type of sporting event involving multirotors. The game will be divided into two equal teams: Offense and Defense.
